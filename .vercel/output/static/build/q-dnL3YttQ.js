She was instantly drawn to the tactile connection between earth, self, creativity and community. In 1990, while visiting a pottery community in Venezuela, Ginger discovered the deeper qualities of clay, and its connection to life and community. The vision for earthen vessels began there in a small pottery community. Returning back to Canada she wanted to create a clay space that was more about this process of connection and she began teaching the first 'Touch the Earth' workshops in 2012. Ginger now trains facilitators to teach this deep side of the clay. 'Earthen Vessels is a studio that emphasizes the power of shared creative experiences, where hands in clay become a means of reflection, connection, and renewal.'",image:"/images/ginger.webp"},{name:"Mary",role:"Facilitator",description:"Mary's journey with clay began in the embrace of family, surrounded by mountains, forests, and lakes.

At Earthen Vessels, she has found both a creative home and a space to pour her love for community.
